# Building a Microservices with Node, Docker and Nginx

This is my practice with Microservices architecture 

## What we will cover?

- What is microservices
- How do we make one?
- How do we make them work together?

## Notes

Microservices architecture is for BIG projects with a lot of people

Docker containers can be used without using Microservices, they are not the same thing!

This is the most common way I see people build container based projects.

## Rule of thumb thoughts (Opinionated)

Docker containers are good for almost project sizes
